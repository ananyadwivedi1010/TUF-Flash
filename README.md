📝Problem Statement

While revising Data Structures & Algorithms, students often face these challenges:

Scattered Notes: Problem solutions are written across notebooks, Google Docs, PDFs, or screenshots. Searching for a specific solution is time-consuming.

Lack of Organization: Difficult to track which topics or problems have been completed and which need revision.

No Personal Repository: Students cannot easily maintain a personal collection of their solved problems with explanations, images, or PDFs.

Inefficient Revision: Revisiting old solutions often requires scrolling through multiple platforms or documents, which slows down learning.

Goal: Create a simple, organized, personalized digital notebook where students can store, view, and track all the DSA problems they’ve studied.

💡 Solution

TUF Flash addresses these challenges by providing:

Personalized Flashcards: Students can create topics (categories) like Arrays, Graphs, Strings, etc., and add problems they’ve solved.

Track Progress: Each problem can have a question, solution, and notes. Quickly see which problems have been studied.

Attach Supporting Materials: Add images or PDF files for explanations, diagrams, or detailed solutions.

Easy Retrieval: Instantly search and revisit any problem in a clean, organized UI.

Offline & Persistent: All flashcards are saved locally in the browser, so students don’t lose their progress.
