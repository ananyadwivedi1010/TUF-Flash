## 📝 Problem Statement

While revising **Data Structures & Algorithms**, students commonly face the following challenges:

1. **Scattered Notes**  
   Solutions are spread across notebooks, Google Docs, PDFs, screenshots, and chats, making searching slow and frustrating.

2. **Lack of Organization**  
   It becomes difficult to track which topics or problems are completed and which still need revision.

3. **No Personal Repository**  
   Students lack a single place to store their solved problems along with explanations, images, or PDFs.

4. **Inefficient Revision**  
   Revisiting old solutions often requires scrolling through multiple platforms, slowing down learning and revision.

### 🎯 Goal
Create a **simple, organized, and personalized digital notebook** where students can store, view, and track all the DSA problems they’ve studied.
